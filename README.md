## Description

[Habit Tracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/habit-tracker/ikcpbmlbgoknannnfcnfhmohpcnlphmn) is a very simple Chrome Extension that lets you add and keep track of your habits.  It displays a dashboard each time you open a new tab.  It is heavily inspired by book [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=EQmnI2AJUH&rank=1) by James Clear.
